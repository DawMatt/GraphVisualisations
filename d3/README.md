Example D3.js visualisations embedded in webpages.

Use `start-web.sh` to start a simple Python 3 web server in this folder. Once that has started the links below will access the relevant pages at localhost (port 8000).

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [int-cfg-01](http://localhost:8000/int-cfg-01.html) | Simple integration configuration |
| [Les Mis - force directed](http://localhost:8000/miserables-fd.html) | This simple force-directed graph shows character co-occurence in Les Misérables. Via [block](https://gist.github.com/anonymous/0e653b6d21c8d57afa234d5d1765efe0) |
| [Les Mis - force directed, curved](http://localhost:8000/miserables-fdc.html) | Shows character co-occurence in Les Misérables. This variation of a force-directed graph uses intermediate nodes in links to create aesthetically-pleasing Bézier curves. Via [block](https://gist.github.com/mbostock/4600693) |
| [Les Mis - force directed, fisheye](http://localhost:8000/miserables-fd-f.html) | Shows character co-occurence in Les Misérables. This variation uses fisheye distortion when hovering over the graph to disambiguate content. Via [block](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/fisheye/) |
| [Les Mis - matrix](http://localhost:8000/miserables-matrix.html) <br/>**Not Working**| Shows character co-occurence in Les Misérables. This variation uses a matrix to present the relationships. Via [block](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/miserables/) |
